# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
Sampling is occurring within a sample of 1000 people in a single time period where each individual attends one of a brunch, or a wedding event. Each of the 2 weddings have 100 attendees, totalling to 200 people, and each of the 80 brunches has 10 attendees, totalling to 800 people (sampling frame). This was assigned to 'events', and the total of 1000 total people ties back to the sample size in the blog post. The model assumes that the chance of each person being infected is 10% (Attack_rate), and primary contact tracing rate is 20%(trace_success). Additionally, under the secondary contact tracing step, when two infections are traced independently to the same source event, every person who attended that event will be tested and 100% of the infections originating at that specific event will be identified (secondary_trace_threshold). 

After running the script in the python file (as provided in A1), the code does the code appears to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post.
The reproducibility of the results is relatively high although not 1:1, due to the use of a random seed.
