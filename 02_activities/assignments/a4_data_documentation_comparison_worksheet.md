Post-election survey: 10,337                         |            112 G. soricina (73 females, 39 males)                                                                                 |
| Target population                                     |            All persons 15 years of age and up in the ten provinces of Canada, excluding full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions                                                                            |             Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older                                |             Neotropical bat (Glossophaga soricina)                     |
| Sampling frame                                        |         Landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address                                                                                  |       Online and through a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey (conducted in parallel)                                       |          Caught individual Glossophaga soricina using mist nets in the Area de Conservaci√≥n de Guanacaste, Costa Rica                                                                                   |
| Survey mode(s)                                        |   Electronic questionnaire                                                                                         |      Online survey                                       |       Caught G.soricina using mist nets in the Area de Conservaci√≥n de Guanacaste, Costa Rica                                                                                     |
| Timeline                                              |      Reference period: Past 12 months preceding interview date. Collection Period: Every 5 years, from September to December                                                                                      |       Campaign Period Survey: September 13th to October 21st, 2019. Post-election survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019                                      |            7-week period from late May to early July 2009                                                                                 |
| Response rate                                         |      41.9%                                                                                      |         Not shared                                    |           Not applicable                                                                                  |
| Weights                                               |    Person weight for respondents that are not 'rejected' and are not volunteers is multiplied by a factor. Weights were adjusted so that the weighted income distribution of GVP matched the 2017 CIS distribution by province. Bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.                                                                                       |          Weights were applied for province, gender, age group, and education level. Note: weights were not applied to the territories respondents.                                   |           Information not provided                                                                                  |
| Data processing                                       |       Edits were performed automatically and manually at various stages of processing at macro and micro levels. They included family, consistency and flow edits. Family relationships were checked to ensure the integrity of matrix data. A series of checks were done to ensure the consistency of survey data, such as checking the respondent age against the respondent birth date.                                                                                      |          Weights were created for the dataset using an iterative "raking'' process, as provided by the ipfraking command in STATA15. Marginal values were successively weighted according to province, as well as gender, age group, and education level. All population data were taken from the 2016 Canadian census. A maximum of 200 iterations were completed.                             |             Information not provided                                                                                |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |                 Imputed personal and family income, formal volunteering variables, and variables in the donation file and solicitation methods in the master file. Missing family income data for 18.3% of households was imputed. Missing personal income data for 18.1% of respondents was imputed.                                                                          |   Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who ‚Äústraight-lined‚Äù grid questions (‚Äústraightliners‚Äù), and respondents whose postal code didn‚Äôt match their province were removed from the data file, and were excluded from numbers reported.                           |        Information not provided                                                                                     |
| Sources of error                                      |     Sampling error due to data being based on sample of persons (estimates).  Non-sampling error due to adjustments to reduce nonresponse bias. Coverage error   where survey estimates were weighted to represent all persons in target population, including those not covered by the survey frame.                                                                                      |          Less severe data quality responses were kept in the survey. If these respondents were excluded, the survey responses would drop to 33,905.                                   |      Acoustic   model is a deliberately conservative approach, which likely underestimates the actual echo-acoustic advantage that G. soricina has over its eared prey.                                                                                     |
| Limitations, known biases                             |     Non-response bias                                                                                     |             Not everyone has access to internet/telephone, and therefore this segement of the population may be under-represented in sampling.                                |           Many bats do not produce a faecal pellet in the short period they are held in captivity.                                                                                   |
